# Stranger, over here.
Welcome to my Github Pages! I regret to inform you that this is still under construction, however.

## The basic idea
Well, since the whole Github Pages concept is to be a description of or a form of documentation for your work...
This will be some documentation on my open source and availlable work.
This will also be used for me to develop my own licenses; an open-source license and a source-availlable license.
