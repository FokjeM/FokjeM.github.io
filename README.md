# Stranger, over here.
Welcome to my Github Pages! I regret to inform you that this is still under construction, however.

## The basic idea
Well, since the whole Github Pages concept is to be a description of or a form of documentation for your work...
This will be some documentation on my open source and availlable work.
This will also be used for me to develop my own licenses; an open-source license and a source-availlable license.

## This is Publishing
The idea here is that *only* the content that is ready to be published gets merged here.
This is also the place to edit for changes and additions and once that's done, it can be merged to master.
